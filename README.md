You can find the API documentation at [api.pm.chillibits.com](https://api.pm.chillibits.com/swagger-ui.html)

## Push endpoint

If you have a sensor from luftdaten.info / sensor.community, you simply have to enable the option 'Feinstaub-App' in the APIs section. The data is transmitted to our server automatically.

If you have built your own IoT device, you can also send data to our system. Setup the connection as follows:

-   Request type: **Post request**
-   Host: **api.pm.chillibits.com**
-   Schema: **https**
-   Port: **443**

The required data format can be found in our API documentation at [api.pm.chillibits.com](https://api.pm.chillibits.com/swagger-ui.html#/push/pushDataUsingPOST)
